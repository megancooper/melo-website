## Description
Melo is a simple music organizer built to help you play and manage audio files on your computer. After loading your local audio files and directories, melo's interface allows you to play and beautifully visualize your music. Melo is powered by [React](https://reactjs.org?ref=melo), [Redux](https://redux.js.org?ref=melo), and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org?ref=melo). Feel free to contribute to melo via pull requests. Also, post any issues you discover while using the app in our issues page.
